# Uber Price Prediction using Machine Learning

![Uber Price Prediction](https://github.com/iamchaitanya7/Uber-Price-Prediction-ML/blob/main/uber-logo-map.jpg)

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on predicting Uber ride prices. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately estimate the price of an Uber ride based on various input features. This can be useful for both riders to estimate their trip costs and for Uber drivers to better understand potential earnings for different trips.

## Introduction

Uber Price Prediction is a common problem in the field of machine learning and data science. This project tackles the challenge of creating a predictive model that considers various factors influencing the price of an Uber ride. By leveraging historical ride data, we aim to develop a model that provides accurate fare estimates.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is crucial to the performance of the model. It should include relevant information such as distance, time of day, traffic conditions, and other potential variables affecting the fare. The dataset can be loaded into the model after appropriate preprocessing and cleaning.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

Clone this repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/uber-price-prediction.git
cd uber-price-prediction
```

## Usage
Ensure you have the required libraries installed as mentioned in the installation section.

Place your dataset (e.g., uber_data.csv) in the repository's root directory.

Open a terminal and navigate to the repository's directory.

Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script that corresponds to data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Model
The model used for Uber price prediction is [describe your chosen model, e.g., a Random Forest regressor]. The features used for prediction include [list the features used, e.g., distance, time, traffic conditions].

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using [mention the evaluation metrics used, e.g., Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)]. The trained model is tested on a separate test dataset to assess its generalization capabilities.

## Deployment
The trained model can be deployed using various methods, including:

Hosting the model on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and creating an API to serve predictions.
Integrating the model into a mobile application for real-time fare estimates.
Developing a web interface where users can input trip details and receive fare predictions.
